Overall, Blender's combination of powerful features, flexibility, and accessibility makes it an attractive choice for designing our 3d artifact. 

  

  

<h2>3d Viewer</h2>

We used the 3d viewer to view our STL files from blender as well as tried to fix it. Due to some spaces in-between meshes. But unfortunately it wasnt much help in fixing the issue, so we decided to use an online STL fixer. 

 

<h2>Online 3d STL fixer</h2>

We used an online STL fixer to try and repair a mesh thickness Issues, STL files, commonly used for 3D printing, sometimes contain errors such as non-manifold geometry, self-intersections, or flipped Normals. And given that we were unsure what was wrong with the design. We chose to use an STL fixer to analise and diagnose and automatically  fix the issue, ensuring that the 3D model is printable without errors. 

 

Also because it was faster and to Saving Time, as manually trying to fixing mesh issues in 3D models can be time-consuming and technically challenging, especially for complex geometries. Using an online STL fixer can save time by automating the repair process, allowing users to focus on other aspects of the project. 

 

Overall, using an online STL fixer helped streamline the process of preparing 3D models for printing by automatically detecting and fixing mesh issues, saving time and effort for users. 

 

  

<h3><p>Fusion 360</p></h3>  

Fusion 360 is a comprehensive computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software developed by Autodesk.  

That provides a unified platform for design, simulation, and manufacturing, allowing users to seamlessly transition between different stages of the product development process without the need for separate software. Offering parametric modeling capabilities, allowing users to create designs that are driven by parameters and constraints.  

This facilitates the exploration of design iterations and makes it easier to make changes to the model. This includes generative design tools that enable users to explore many design options based on specified constraints and objectives. 

 

Fusion 360 has a built-in simulation and analysis tools that allow users to evaluate the performance and behavior of their designs under various conditions. This helps identify potential issues early in the design process and optimize designs for better performance. 

 

Seamlessly integrates computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) capabilities, allowing users to generate toolpaths directly from their 3D models for CNC machining, 3D printing, and other manufacturing processes. This streamlines the transition from design to manufacturing. 

Overall, Fusion 360's integrated design environment, cloud-based collaboration, generative design capabilities, and simulation tools make it a powerful and versatile solution for product development across various industries. 

We chose to used fusion 360 for the creation of the concentric cam that showcases the motion of breath in the artifact (parrot), due to is ability to simulate and analyst its workings. We used fusion 360 because of its relation to engineering functionality. Which made it easier to calculate and measure what was needed to 3d print and attach and simulate/ showcase the motion need in the artifact.</p>

								<p>3D printing hardware and workshop facilities 

This was where the printing of the artifact took place. The centerpiece of any 3D printing workshop is the 3D printer itself. There are various types of 3D printers available, including Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), and Digital Light Processing (DLP) printers. Each type has its own strengths and limitations in terms of printing speed, resolution, material compatibility, and cost. 

  

Depending on the type of 3D printer being used, you'll need the appropriate printing materials. For FDM printers, this typically means thermoplastic filaments such as PLA, ABS, PETG, or TPU. For SLA and DLP printers, liquid resins are used, which cure under ultraviolet (UV) light. It's essential to have a variety of materials on hand to accommodate different printing requirements and applications. 

 

equipped with computers and design software are essential for designing 3D models, preparing them for printing, and controlling the 3D printers. Depending on the complexity of the designs and the software being used, the workstations should have sufficient processing power and memory to handle the workload efficiently. 

 

Regular maintenance and calibration are necessary to keep 3D printers running smoothly and producing high-quality prints. This may involve tools such as calipers, leveling gauges, lubricants, and spare parts. It's important to establish a maintenance schedule and keep track of maintenance tasks to ensure the longevity of your equipment. 

Providing training and documentation for workshop staff and users is crucial for ensuring safe and effective operation of the 3D printing facilities. This includes user manuals, troubleshooting guides, and hands-on training sessions covering equipment operation, maintenance procedures, and safety protocols.  

 

Upon our design's completion, we forwarded the STL file to the 3D printing hardware workshop for physical production.  

Resin production and postproduction, and composite workshop facilities  

We used Pla and airdry clay for the final print of the artifact.  

Reference Image  

reference image, also known simply as a reference, is an image used by artists, designers, or creators as a visual guide or inspiration when working on a project. It serves as a point of reference for various aspects of the project, such as composition, proportions, colors, textures, and details. 

  

Reference images can be sourced from various places, including photographs, sketches, paintings, or digital images. They can depict a wide range of subjects, including objects, scenes, characters, architecture, nature, and more, depending on the specific requirements of the project. 

Using reference images can help ensure accuracy and consistency in the final outcome of the project. 

Below is a few reference images used for the development of our artifact </p>

								<p>Design process 

Importing the Image: Start by importing the 2D image of the parrot into Blender. This can be done by selecting "File" > "Import" > "Images as Planes" and choosing the image file. 

 

Setting Up Reference: Once the image is imported, position it appropriately in the 3D viewport to use it as a reference for modeling. You can adjust the transparency of the image to make it easier to see the modeling grid behind it. 

 

Modeling: Begin modeling the parrot by adding basic shapes such as cubes, spheres, and cylinders, then use tools like extrusion, scaling, and vertex manipulation to sculpt the shapes into the desired form, matching the contours of the parrot in the reference image. 

 

Refining Details: As you progress, continue refining the details of the model to capture the intricacies of the parrot's features such as its beak, feathers, and wings. Use subdivision surface modifiers to smooth out surfaces and add finer details. 

 

Exporting to STL: Once the model is complete and textured, it can be exported to an STL file format suitable for 3D printing. To do this, select the entire model, then go to "File" > "Export" > "STL (.STL)" and choose a location to save the file. 

 

Checking for Errors: Before 3D printing, it's essential to check the exported STL file for any errors such as non-manifold geometry or intersecting faces. Blender has built-in tools like the 3D Print Toolbox addon that can help identify and fix these issues. 

 

3D Printing: Finally, the STL file can be loaded into a 3D printing software, where settings such as scale, orientation, and print quality can be adjusted. Once everything is set up, start the printing process and wait for the parrot model to be printed layer by layer.
