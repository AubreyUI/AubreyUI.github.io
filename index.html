								<p>We decided on creating a “parrot” for our artifact, using its chest to showcase motion, and agreed to use blender to create, design, and model our artifact “parrot”.  

Technologies used 

These are the various techniques/software used for the development of the artifact. 

Blender 

We decided to use blender because of it user friendly interface, it a popular choice for 3D modeling, animation, rendering. Also, because blender is open-source and free, meaning it's freely available to download and use. which makes it accessible to us as students without the need for expensive licenses. 

 

It has a comprehensive feature (set of user-friendly tools) that encompasses various aspects of 3D creation, that includes modeling, sculpting, texturing, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, video editing and more. It ,lkl 's basically an all-in-one which reduces the need to switch between different software for different tasks. 

 

These tools allow users (“Students”) to create complex 3D models with precision and detail. Plus, Blender also offers a highly flexible workflow, allowing users to customize the interface, create custom shortcuts, and tailor the software to their specific needs and preferences. This flexibility enhances productivity and efficiency. 

 

Even though it wasn't taken advantage of Blender's built-in real-time rendering engine, allows users to preview their scenes in real-time with high-quality visuals. This enables faster iteration and feedback during the creative process. 

 

Not to mention its Cross-Platform Compatibility, Blender is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems. This allows users to work seamlessly across multiple platforms and environments. 

 

Overall, Blender's combination of powerful features, flexibility, and accessibility makes it an attractive choice for designing our 3d artifact. 

  

  

3d viewer  

We used the 3d viewer to view our STL files from blender as well as tried to fix it. Due to some spaces in-between meshes. But unfortunately it wasnt much help in fixing the issue, so we decided to use an online STL fixer. 

 

Online 3d STL fixer  

We used an online STL fixer to try and repair a mesh thickness Issues, STL files, commonly used for 3D printing, sometimes contain errors such as non-manifold geometry, self-intersections, or flipped Normals. And given that we were unsure what was wrong with the design. We chose to use an STL fixer to analise and diagnose and automatically  fix the issue, ensuring that the 3D model is printable without errors. 

 

Also because it was faster and to Saving Time, as manually trying to fixing mesh issues in 3D models can be time-consuming and technically challenging, especially for complex geometries. Using an online STL fixer can save time by automating the repair process, allowing users to focus on other aspects of the project. 

 

Overall, using an online STL fixer helped streamline the process of preparing 3D models for printing by automatically detecting and fixing mesh issues, saving time and effort for users. 

 

  

Fusion 360  

Fusion 360 is a comprehensive computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software developed by Autodesk.  

That provides a unified platform for design, simulation, and manufacturing, allowing users to seamlessly transition between different stages of the product development process without the need for separate software. Offering parametric modeling capabilities, allowing users to create designs that are driven by parameters and constraints.  

This facilitates the exploration of design iterations and makes it easier to make changes to the model. This includes generative design tools that enable users to explore many design options based on specified constraints and objectives. 

 

Fusion 360 has a built-in simulation and analysis tools that allow users to evaluate the performance and behavior of their designs under various conditions. This helps identify potential issues early in the design process and optimize designs for better performance. 

 

Seamlessly integrates computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) capabilities, allowing users to generate toolpaths directly from their 3D models for CNC machining, 3D printing, and other manufacturing processes. This streamlines the transition from design to manufacturing. 

Overall, Fusion 360's integrated design environment, cloud-based collaboration, generative design capabilities, and simulation tools make it a powerful and versatile solution for product development across various industries. 

We chose to used fusion 360 for the creation of the concentric cam that showcases the motion of breath in the artifact (parrot), due to is ability to simulate and analyst its workings. We used fusion 360 because of its relation to engineering functionality. Which made it easier to calculate and measure what was needed to 3d print and attach and simulate/ showcase the motion need in the artifact.</p>

								<p>Design process 

Importing the Image: Start by importing the 2D image of the parrot into Blender. This can be done by selecting "File" > "Import" > "Images as Planes" and choosing the image file. 

 

Setting Up Reference: Once the image is imported, position it appropriately in the 3D viewport to use it as a reference for modeling. You can adjust the transparency of the image to make it easier to see the modeling grid behind it. 

 

Modeling: Begin modeling the parrot by adding basic shapes such as cubes, spheres, and cylinders, then use tools like extrusion, scaling, and vertex manipulation to sculpt the shapes into the desired form, matching the contours of the parrot in the reference image. 

 

Refining Details: As you progress, continue refining the details of the model to capture the intricacies of the parrot's features such as its beak, feathers, and wings. Use subdivision surface modifiers to smooth out surfaces and add finer details. 

 

Exporting to STL: Once the model is complete and textured, it can be exported to an STL file format suitable for 3D printing. To do this, select the entire model, then go to "File" > "Export" > "STL (.STL)" and choose a location to save the file. 

 

Checking for Errors: Before 3D printing, it's essential to check the exported STL file for any errors such as non-manifold geometry or intersecting faces. Blender has built-in tools like the 3D Print Toolbox addon that can help identify and fix these issues. 

 

3D Printing: Finally, the STL file can be loaded into a 3D printing software, where settings such as scale, orientation, and print quality can be adjusted. Once everything is set up, start the printing process and wait for the parrot model to be printed layer by layer.
